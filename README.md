# weaponLength
measure the length of various weapons using continuous binary search

Walk onto the "begin test" plate as if you were walking off the edge. The collider is just at the edge to ensure there is always enough room. 

When the target is present, swing at it. Wait for it to reappear whether you miss or hit. The estimated distance will converge in the chat. 

You will not be able to move while the test is in progress, but you can still look around. For accurate results, do not look around. The use of slomo may affect testing accuracy. 

For comparable test results, please do not change your look angle from the one you have on spawn.
